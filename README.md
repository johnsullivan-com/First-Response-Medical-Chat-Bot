======================= First Response Bot ============================

This project is meant to be a greater step into my expertise and to show my growth.
This is my very own chatbot that uses chainlit, langchain, and a slightly older version of Llama to answer any questions about first aid from the user.
Special thanks to the MIT licensed content creator "AIAnytime" for their helpful AI tutorial videos

Requirements to use:
- Install all packages as part of reqs.txt using pip install
- Make sure you use pydantic 2.9.0 for all dependencies to be compatible
- No GPU required

- run "chainlit run model.py" from the command line that is opened from the project folder
